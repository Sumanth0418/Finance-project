# Finance-Analysis-project

## Overview

Welcome to the Finance Analysis project! In this project, we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices for various banks. Please note that this project is intended for practicing visualization and pandas skills, and it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or financial advice.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the analysis, let's set up our environment and gather the necessary data. In this section, we will learn how to use pandas to directly read data from Google Finance.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:


## Data

We need to get stock information for the following banks:

- Bank of America
- CitiGroup
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Wells Fargo

### Retrieving Stock Data

For each bank, we will retrieve stock data from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2016. Each bank's data will be stored in a separate DataFrame with the variable name being its ticker symbol. Here are the steps involved:

1. Use datetime to set start and end datetime objects.
2. Figure out the ticker symbol for each bank.
3. Use datareader to grab information on the stock.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this GitHub repository hosts a data analysis project focused on exploratory data analysis of stock prices for various banks. The project is designed to help practitioners enhance their visualization and pandas skills. It is important to note that the analysis presented here is not intended to serve as robust financial analysis or financial advice.
